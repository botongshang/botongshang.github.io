# Job Market Paper
## Opportunistic Strategy in Corporate Fraud
Botong Shang, September 2020. [Download](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3710224)

> <div style="text-align: justify"> I develop and estimate, using hand-collected data, a game-theoretical model of strategic corporate fraud, that incorporates and quantifies firms' adjustments in fraud propensities in response to regulators' information processing capacity. The findings are economically significant. A one standard deviation change in different regulatory interventions is associated with an annual increase of 10 to 58 fraudulent cases. I exploit the 2005 option backdating scandal as an exogenous shock to regulatory attention, and find further support for both the opportunism in fraud and the deterrence effect. I document that fraudulent behavior is heterogeneous in executive incentives and firm complexity.

## Real Effects in the Option Market

><div style="text-align: justify"> I investigate whether and how managers extract private information from the option market to guide investment decisions. The level of private information is negatively associated with the sensitivity of both investment amount and timing to implied volatility. This finding is consistent with the real options theory, where managers extract market-expected uncertainty from the option market. Managerial learning from the option market is beneficial to firms by improving investment efficiency. Cross-sectional variation in real effects aligns with predictions based on investment irreversibility, executive incentives, and industry competition. The results are robust to alternative explanations.
