Thank you for visiting my webpage. I am a PhD student in finance at the University of Rochester. My research focuses on information economics within the field of empirical finance, with an emphasis on strategic interaction.  In my [job market paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3710224) I explore the strategic interaction between firms and the regulator by investigating firms' opportunistic strategy in corporate fraud decisions taking into account the potential cost associated with the SEC regulatory interventions. You can find further information about my research [here](https://botongshang.github.io/research/).
