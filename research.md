## Real Effects in the Option Market

> I investigate whether managers learn from the option market and howmanagers use this information in investment decisions. I find a strong negative relation between  the  level  of  private  information  and  the  investment  sensitivity  to implied volatility, and that this managerial learning is beneficial to firms, as learning-adjustedinvestment  is  positively  associated  with  future  performance.   My  findings  supportboth a real option channel and an external financing channel underlying manageriallearning.  Cross-sectional variation in the real effects aligns with predictions based onexecutive incentives, industry competition, and investment irreversibility.  The resultsare robust to a vast set of alternative explanations.
